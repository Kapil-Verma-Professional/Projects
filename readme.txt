In my project, I developed a Python script called "finddbtableandcolumnnames.py" to extract the database tables and column names from the "cma-artworks.db" database. 
By leveraging the Python SQLite3 API, I implemented a script that provided a comprehensive list of tables and their associated column names.
To ensure ease of use,
Additionally, I created another Python script named "extractdata.py,". This script utilized the table names and column names obtained from "finddbtableandcolumnnames.py" to extract data from the "cma-artworks.db" database.
The extracted data was then converted into JSON format and saved in a text file named "artworks.txt
By developing these scripts, I was able to efficiently retrieve essential information from the database and transform it into a structured format for further analysis or utilization. 
These scripts showcase my proficiency in Python programming, database querying, data extraction, and data transformation techniques.
